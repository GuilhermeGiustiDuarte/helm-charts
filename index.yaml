    description: Atlassian Confluence Server is where you create, organise and discuss
      work with your team. Capture the knowledge that's too often lost in email inboxes
      and shared network drives in Confluence - where it's easy to find, use, and
      update. Give every team, project, or department its own space to create the
      things they need, whether it's meeting notes, product requirements, file lists,
      or project plans, you can get more done in Confluence.
